### Customer Journey Solution

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

**Answer:**
```
SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    p.plan_name,
    s.start_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id;
```

We can take a look on the Customer 6's journey

Here we can see that the customer 6's journey starts with the trial on 2020-12-23, and when the trial ends they upgrade to the basic monthly plan on 2020-12-30. After a couple of month they churn the subscriptions on 2021-02-26.
